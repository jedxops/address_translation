Development completed. Actively performing testing operations to find and cure bugs.
We are aiming to determine the correctness of this program so we feel safe turning
our _complete_ attention towards the web app, which is the next step.

PLEASE SEE THE README.md file for more information on the road map and for details
that could assist a future potential developer (like how-tos on building, running,
and testing the code).
